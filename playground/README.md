# Playground

This is a directory to house projects that don't have their own home but I'd like somewhere public.
Instead of creating multiple small repos, they can start here and then be moved out if they amount to anything.
Reutilizing functions from my setup means

- Setup is faster since I can reuse expressions from my root flake
- Build time are quick since I'm reusing the same packages instead of each project having different versions.
