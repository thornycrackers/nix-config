# Script for joining all the paragraphs in a markdown file. I like to write in
# one sentence per line in markdown. If you publish markdown in that format,
# the paragraph looks normal. Sometime's I need to copy the text though and
# paste it into something else (Slack, Google Docs). Perl is great for
# multi-line searches. Chatgpt is great at helping me write them cause I can't
# do jack in perl.
#
# Prompt (Had to add \@\[ manually though)
#
# write a perl one liner that will do multi line searches to find a
# periods, explanation marks, or question marks next to a newline character
# followed by any alpha numeric character or a closing bracket and replace
# it with an the symbol that was found and a blank space. Do not replace
# any lines that have a newline followed by another newline. Only target
# lines that have existing text or special characters on them.
