# Cody, what the fuck are you doing?
# Well future Cody, there are two scenarios I'm trying to satisfy
# 1.) launch lf, hit enter, result: open file in neovim
# 2.) launch neovim, <leader>m to open lf in float term, hit enter: open file
#     in parent window
#
# To get 2.) to work you can just add `map <enter> open`. The issue is getting
# 1.) to work. So I will look for OPENER being xdg-open (the default value) and
# update it to be nvim. I don't understand how floatterm does it because using
# the echo results don't appear but if you remap `map <enter>` to something
# else it opens in the float term and not the parent. This is confusing but it
# works.
cmd open ${{
    if [[ $OPENER = "xdg-open" ]]; then
        OPENER="nvim"
    fi
    $OPENER $f
